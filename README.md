# Installing the SQLite3 Driver for Node.js

    sudo apt-get update
    npm install sqlite3 --save
    
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.

    sudo apt-get install npm
    npm install express --save

To run your code, first open your server port using node file_name.js in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations with database.
